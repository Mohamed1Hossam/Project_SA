            <p class="p-DF">Muscle cars are meant to bark through the neighborhood between streetlights, and the Dodge
                Charger has
                been off its leash for plenty of years now. More than a decade into its current generation, the
                seemingly ageless Charger comes standard with a 292-hp V-6 and rear-wheel drive, with an all-wheel drive
                option should you need it. Consider this version the calm older dog of the lineup. But there’s also bark
                and bite in the Charger family. Step up to the R/T trim for the 370-hp 5.7-liter V-8 engine. Scat Pack
                models get even more power, with a 6.4-liter, 485-hp V-8. The tire-killing supercharged Hellcat models
                get even wilder but are reviewed separately. If the Charger drives like an old cop car, that’s because
                it is. And while the world shifts to alternative energy, the Charger keeps on chugging along as a sedan
                version of the coupe-bodied, gasoline-fired Challenger. One day cars like the Charger will be against
                all the rules, but for now this V-8-powered sedan remains loud and proud.</p>

        <p class="p-DF">While rival muscle cars have pivoted recently toward sharp handling, the 2023 Dodge Challenger
            keeps
            things retro with a package that’s designed more for old-school pony-car jollies and straight-line
            speed. A V-6 engine is standard in these non-SRT Challengers but the real fun comes with the optional
            naturally aspirated Hemi V-8 engines, which are offered in a variety of displacements and outputs
            spanning a 375-hp, 5.7-liter to a 485-hp, 6.4-liter. If you want even more power, Dodge will be happy to
            oblige with the big-stomper Challenger SRT Hellcat, which we review separately. The regular Challenger
            isn’t as intense as the outrageous Hellcat, but for some its V-8 burble and relatively comfortable ride
            will be enough to trigger nostalgic feelings for the vintage Dodge pony cars with which it shares a
            name. Enthusiast drivers will find modern versions of the Chevrolet Camaro and the Ford Mustang more
            capable on twisty roads and racetracks, but the Challenger’s old-school charm is undeniable. </p>

        <p class="p-DF">The Durango might not appeal to a broad audience, but its performance and practicality are
            certainly
            impressive. After all, not many SUVs can hit 60 mph in under 5 seconds and tow up to 8,700 pounds. But what
            you get in capability you lack in refinement. As well equipped as the Durango might be, you are constantly
            reminded this is one of the older platforms on the market.</p>

            the Hornet makes a whopping 268 horsepower in base form. The Hornet is based on the same architecture that

            in option pumping out 288 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque available in
